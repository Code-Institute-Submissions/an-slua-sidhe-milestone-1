# **THE _CORR MHÓNA_ BAND WEBSITE**

![Corr Mhóna Banner Logo](assets/images/banner-logo1.jpg "Corr Mhóna Banner Logo")

## **Introduction**

**This** is the official [**Corr Mhóna**](https://an-slua-sidhe.github.io/milestone-1/) website.

It was designed by me, **Paul Quinn**, to give the band a greater independent online presence. I initally designed and developed the site from the ground up as part of my [Fullstack Web Development Diploma](https://codeinstitute.net/courses/) with the **Code Institute**, Ireland. The end goal is to provide a fully interactive website for the band, with e-commerce functionality.

The band already had an online presence through third party sites such as [Bandcamp](https://corrmona.bandcamp.com/) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/corrmhona/). However, there was a desire to cut out the middle man and provide the band's fans with the means to quickly and easily access merchandise, information and gig announcements on a single platform. As a band member myself, I decided to undertake this task with the skills I had learned during the course.

A variety of features have been implemented already, and there are several more to come in the near future. I have used the band's own assets to populate the site and inspire its design. There is a full overview of the design/development process below, along with an extensive outline of the testing process, future features, user stories, responsivity and deployment.

## **User Experience**

**Corr Mhóna** has always prided itself on following a few founding principles; Making use of natural elements both musically and lyrically, organically combining whatever styles suit the music we write, promoting the Irish language, and avoiding narcissistic imagery and remaining grounded when connecting with out fans.

I have tried to use these principles when creating a User Experience for our website, constructing a site that has clean organic lines and colours, that delivers relevant content to the user simply and efficiently, and that is also available in the Irish language.

### **User Stories**

There are a number of different types of user which may visit the site, each with different goals and motivations. I have listed them below in five categories; The Band Member, The Music Fan, The Promoter, The Journalist, The Record Label.

#### The Band Member

- As band member, I can easily put the latest information up on the **News** section of the [**Home**](index.html) page, so that fans and promoters are kept updated.
- As band member, I can embed media from the latest project in the **Media** section of the [**Home**](index.html) page, to make the latest release more exciting and interesting for our fans.
- As band member, I can advertise that the band is available for gigs and festivals through the [**Contact**](contact.html) page of the site.
- As band member, I will eventually be able to add merchandise and CDs to the **Shop** page, so I can sell directly to the fans.

#### The Music Fan

- As a music fan, I can find out everything I need to know about the band in one place, when I search for new music to listen to.
- As a metal music fan specifically interested in Celtic/Gaelic/folk music, I can find the band site through certain keywords found throughout the site.
- As a music fan who has been recommended the band by a friend, I can find everything I need on the site (through the [**Biography**](bio.html) {'The Band'} & [**Discography**](disc.html) pages) to decide whether the band is for me.
- As a music fan who has seen the band live, I can get a clear idea of the bands sound through listening to music on the **Audio Player** or watching the **Teaser Video** in the **Media** section.
- As a music fan who already knows/likes the band, I can check the **Home** page for the latest news on gigs and upcoming releases, and I will soon be able to visit the **Shop** page to puchase the latest merchandise and CDs.
- As a music fan, I can get in touch with the band on the [**Contact**](contact.html) page and let the band know why I am making contact through the **Contact Form**.

#### **The Promoter**

- As promoter, I can check the **News** section to see if the band are currently active and looking for gigs.
- As promoter, I can use the [**Contact**](contact.html) page to get in touch with the band, and specifically let them know that I am interested in booking them for gigs via the **Contact Form**.

#### **The Journalist**

- As journalist who has been sent a copy of the latest CD to review, I can get more information about the band to complete my review by visiting the [**Home**](index.html), [**Biography**](bio.html) {'The Band'} & [**Discography**](disc.html) pages of the site.
- As journalist who is completing a feature about the band, I can find more information from the same locations mentioned above, as well as finding extra musical and visual content in the **Media** section, as well as the [**Biography**](bio.html) {'The Band'} & [**Discography**](disc.html) pages.

#### **The Record Label**

- As a record label employee who has been sent a promo pack from the band, I can browse the site to get a feel for the ethos and imagery the band is looking to evoke.
- As a record label employee who has been recommended the band byu another professional or promoter, I can get in contact with the band via the [**Contact**](contact.html) page and specifically tell the band the reason I am making contact through the **Contact Form**.

### **Wireframes**

I used Adobe XD to design and create **Wireframes** for the site. It was decided to have a multi-page site from the beginning, as well as to follow the the principal of **Mobile First**. I followed the usual method of keeping the basic wireframes extremely simple stylistically, mostly focusing on the form, location and interaction between the various elements of the site on each page. I then used the band's assets to decide on the colour palette, theme and artistic direction of the site.

#### **Basic Wireframes**

The basic wireframes are available within this repository in two PDFs; one for [Mobile](assets/wireframes/wireframes-mobile.pdf) and one for [Desktop](assets/wireframes/wireframes-desktop.pdf). There is a separate wireframe for each of the four site pages in each PDF. Any colour used is for contrast only. Simple text headings were added to each element to denote its purpose. These overall [**Design Choices**](#design-choices) can be traced to the final deployed [**Website**](https://an-slua-sidhe.github.io/milestone-1/), with some changes (see [**Design Changes**](#design-changes)).

### **Design Choices**

asfdsdaf

### **Design Changes**

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

___

## **Features**

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### **Existing Features**

- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### **Future Features**

- Another feature idea

___

## **Technologies Used**

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.

___

## **Testing**

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

___

## **Deployment**

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
